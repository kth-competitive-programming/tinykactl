LGrind - a source pretty printer for LaTeX
=-----
Version 3.67

Welcome to LGrind. LGrind is a descendant of the Unix utility vgrind. It is
used to produce a beautified version of your source code using LaTeX. Unlike
other packages this is not pure TeX but an external preprocessor. You run e.g.
    lgrind example.c > example.tex
    latex example.tex
to get a complete listing. Options for producing includable files and pro-
cessing embedded listings in LaTeX texts are provided.


What you need: (Installation part 2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- lgrind        (or lgrind.exe) just where you like it
- lgrind.sty    somewhere in LaTeXs reach
- lgrindef      anywhere; (position is semi-fixed in the executable)
- LaTeX2e       the obsolete LaTeX 2.09 is not supported
- LGrind utilizes by default the fancyhdr package by Piet van Oostrum. You
  can change this behaviour by modifying the lgrindef file.


How to get these files: (Installation part 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- If your executable is not provided, all the  source files are in the source
  directory, a makefile provided.
- Run LaTeX or TeX on lgrind.ins. You will obtain lgrind.sty.
- Or simply run make in the top directory. This also gives lgrind.sty


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Main documentation is in lgrind.dtx. Run LaTeX on lgrind.dtx and the result is
lgrind.dvi. There are also manpages lgrind.1 and lgrindef.5 for people who
prefer those, but notice that I am not always able to keep them up to date.
To right the wrong impression: parts of the documentation have been written
by my predecessors, my thanks to them.

Comments, contributions, questions and cheques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LGrind contains non-free code written by Van Jacobson, who does not answer
to any request for changing his licence. This software is therefore not
maintained. I also do not accept any cheques anymore.

Have Fun!
